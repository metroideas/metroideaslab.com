    <p>Come grab a cup of coffee in our Highland Park cafe. We would love to meet you and tell you a little bit about our work. We have plenty of work space and greenery. We think it's a pretty cool place to do some big thinking or just to kick back and relax.</p>

        <h3>Wonk Wednesday featuring Welcoming America</h3>
        <time datetime="2017-06-28T17:30:00-04:00">Wednesday, June 28 at 5:30 p.m.</time>
        <p>What makes a welcoming city for immigrants in the United States? We're partnering with <a style="display:inline;" href="https://www.facebook.com/ctacollective/">Coming to America: The Story of Us</a> to hear personal stories from immigrants in Chattanooga. What were their first impressions coming to the United States? Of Chattanooga? Of our city government? We'll also hear from Isha Lee, chief network officer at Welcoming America, about what cities and mayors can do to make their cities a welcoming place for immigrants during such a sensitive time in our nation's history.</p>
        <p>Beer, wine, coffee and snacks will be on hand to keep the conversation going. This event is free and open to the public. Beer and wine provided for individuals ages 21 and up.</p>
